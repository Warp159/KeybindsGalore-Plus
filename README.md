## How to Use

KeybindsGalore+ will automatically detect conflicting keybinds!

- **Pressing** a conflicted key *down* will **open the pie menu**
- **Releasing** a conflicted key (when the pie menu is displayed) will **activate the highlighted action** and **close** the pie menu
- **Clicking** on a section of the pie menu (without releasing the key) will **activate the highlighted action** and **deactivate** it when the key is **released**

NB: When the pie menu *opens*, all actions currently activated (e.g. holding a key down) will be deactivated.

## Modifications to Original

- Optimised conflict searching
- Keybind labels now show their category along with their name
- Customisable keybind labels (see [this issue](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus/issues/3))
- Label texts no longer run off the screen
- Fully customisable pie menu
- Allows compatibility with non-vanilla keybinds (insert your mod's keybinds into the [conflict table](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus/blob/1.21/src/main/java/me/av306/keybindsgaloreplus/KeybindManager.java) whenever convenient!)
- **And more...**
